        <p><strong>Description</strong></p> 
        <p>This miso chicken noodle soup, with thick, chewy udon noodles and a savory miso broth, is a tasty—and very easy—remake of traditional chicken noodle soup.
            We just love all of the ways that one can play with a traditional Chicken Noodle Soup and completely transform the flavors. Here, 
            We’ve combined a good old fashioned Miso Soup with Chicken Noodle Soup to make quite a wonderful concoction of a Miso Chicken Noodle Soup. 
            It’s simple to make and bursting with flavor and a Chicken Soup that will certainly spice up your weeknight. <p>
        <p>If you’ve never cooked with Miso Paste, it’s really simple and really does all the work on its own. You can find Miso Paste in the fridge section at your local grocery store, usually near the other refrigerated condiments. 
            I absolutely love using miso paste in soups, salad dressings, or marinades to add a fabulous element of flavor to everyday dishes. </p>
