        <p><strong>Description</strong></p> 
        <p>The best <strong><em>Korean Fried Chicken</em></strong> – crispy coated buttermilk fried chicken smothered in a spicy Korean-inspired gochujang sauce.
            The sauce is so rich, flavourful and complex and it comes together very easily – just throw all the ingredients in a pan and bubble it up.
            We love to eat this with rice, noodles, or my personal favourite – stuffed into bao buns!<p>
        <p>One thing that I absolutely love as a recipe creator, is when I put a plate of food down in front of people, and the conversation stops the moment the first bite is taken. Just quiet, wide-eyed, satisfied munching, with the occasional 
            <em>‘Mmmmm‘</em> and <em>‘oh my god, it’s so good‘</em> until it’s all gone.</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Celery salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>First we marinade the chicken in buttermilk, salt, white pepper and garlic salt.</li>
            <li>Then we coat the chicken in my special secret mixture. Only joking, it’s not secret. Find the full mixture in the recipe card below.</li>
            <li>The spicy gochujang sauce is made using a mixture of gochujang paste, honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic and ginger that’s been bubbled together until sticky and syrupy.</li>
            <li>Then we fry the chicken until golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture over the crispy chicken and top with sesame seeds, spring onions and a few red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy silently with no distractions.</li>
        </ol>
